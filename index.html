    Hello everyone! My name Furkan Canga. I live in Ankara which is the capital of Turkey. I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at Middle East Technical University. 
    I started coding when I was in High School. However, I have given a long break until this year. I started to chase my coding ambition again.
